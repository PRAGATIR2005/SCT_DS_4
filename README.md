Traffic Accident Data Analysis

 Objective:-
In this project, the goal is to analyze *traffic accident data* to identify patterns and relationships related to *road conditions, **weather, and **time of day*. The objective is to gain insights into accident hotspots and the contributing factors to traffic accidents. The project will also include visualizations to help understand these patterns better.

 Key Features:-
- *Traffic Accident Analysis*: The dataset is analyzed to identify any patterns related to the conditions under which accidents occur, including weather conditions and time of day.
- *Accident Hotspots*: The project will identify areas with a high concentration of accidents, known as hotspots, and examine possible contributing factors.
- *Data Visualization*: Various types of visualizations will be created to present the findings, such as accident trends over time, weather-related accidents, and accident frequency by location.

Tools and Libraries:-
- *Python*: The programming language used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- *Pandas*: Used to clean, preprocess, and manipulate the accident data.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: Libraries used to create visualizations such as bar charts, heat maps, and time-series plots.
- *Jupyter Notebook/Colab*: Interactive environments for writing and running Python code for analysis and visualization.

Conclusion:-
By the end of this project, you'll have gained insights into traffic accident trends and factors like road conditions, weather, and the time of day. The analysis will highlight accident hotspots and help identify patterns, providing useful information that could improve traffic safety measures and policies.
